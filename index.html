            <h3>What does finally do?</h3>
            <p>Finally lets the coder execute code after the try and catch no matter what the result of the try and catch are.</p>
            <h3>What challenges did you face in completing this assignment and how did you overcome them?</h3>
            <p>I ran into some challenges with checking the grade input against a group of numbers. Once I decided to use an array, and after a little research, it got more simple.</p>
            <h3>The form above is somewhat contrived. What ideas would you have to improve the form and the user experience? Explain.</h3>
            <p>I thought it would be nice for the user to recieve alerts in the browser if there was a problem with their application, so I added those. I think a little more depth into who the user is, 
                for example a "Tell Us About You" input or an email field so we have a contact to the user.</p>
